          <h2></h2>
          <p>Since 1998 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medicinal use and in 2012 Colorado and Washington state legalized the recreational use of marijuana.
             Since that time several other states have legalized the recreational use or medical use of marijuana.  Opponents of these changes to drug policy have suggested 
             that legalizing marijuana would lead to more people using marijuana.  They have been especially concerned about increased use in young people.  
             This table shows the interaction between legalization status in 2008-2009 and 2016-2017(1- Recreational, 2-Medical, and 3- Prohibited) and 
             the percent of the population who has used marijuana in the last year in 2008-2009 and 2016-2017.  </p>

          <p>Overall, marijuana use went down from 2008-2009 to 2016-2017 for people 12 to 17 years old (2008-2009 Mean = 13.46; 2016-2017 Mean = 12.68).   On the other hand, 
            marijuana use for adults (18 and older) increased (2008-2009 Mean = 10.67; 2016-2017 Mean = 15.16).  The chart shows differences in marijuana use by state legalization 
            status in both periods 2008-2009 and 2016-2017. In states where medical marijuana is legal in 2008-2009 marijuana use in the last year decreased for people between the 
            ages of 12 and 17 between the 2008/2009 and 2016/2017 survey periods (2008-2009 M-15.98 SD-1.41; 2016-2017 M-15.32 SD-1.73).  In states where marijuana in prohibited in 
            2008-2009 marijuana use in the last year decreased for people between the ages of 12 and 17 between the 2008/2009 and 2016/2017 survey periods (2008-2009 M-12.57 SD-1.86; 2016-2017 M-11.76 SD-2.09).  
            Marijuana use went up significantly (p=.01) for people 18 and older in states where marijuana was legal for medicinal use and prohibited in 2008/2009.   </p>

          <p>When we look at the difference in marijuana use between 2008/2009 and 2016/2017 in states divided up by legalization status in 2017 use by people 12 to 17 years old went 
            down in all states. The greatest decrease was seen in states that legalized recreational marijuana (2008-2009 M-16.43 SD-1.59; 2016-2017 M-15.77 SD-1.41).  Conversely, 
            the states that where marijuana was legalized for recreational use saw the greatest increase in adult use (2008-2009 M-13.73 SD-1.82; 2016-2017 M- 22.01 SD-3.86). </p>
